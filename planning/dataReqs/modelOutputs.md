What we want each model to output:

Run model:
Side of run
Formation ( shotgun or no)
Personnel (# of rbs, # of wrs)
Gap

Pass model:
formation 
Personnel 
Air yards
Route that was thrown to
Pass location




Note for INPUT of pass model:

Potentially consider YAC in relation to the air yards (i.e. 20 YAC after 2 air yards means it was probably a successful screen so it should be considered in the play’s success, whereas 5 YAC after 40 air yards is probably a receiver breaking a tackle or something so it shouldn’t be weighed as heavily.)
